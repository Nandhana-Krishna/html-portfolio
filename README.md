# html-portfolio
This is my first HTML project hosted on GitHub. It serves as a beginner's exploration of HTML and web development. The project includes  HTML files that showcases various HTML elements. It is designed to demonstrate basic HTML structure and syntax, as well as provide a starting point for learning and experimenting with web development.
